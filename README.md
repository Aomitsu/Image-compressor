#Image Compressor Python
###Simple image compressor using PIL

Hi !
This project is my first real useful thing in Python, it's really basic and will be improved by me... or by you!

Anyway, suggest improvements, I'm a beginner.
Basically, I wanted to use it in my social network, but I don't think it performs well enough, especially in Python.
And since I have no public repository, I'm posting a single one!

###Usage

````shell script
py compress.py "Path/to/image"
````
###Features
- Compress images

###To-Do
- [ ] Make it better.
- [ ] Maybe change the language.
- [ ] Support videos.
- [ ] Reduce the size further without altering the quality.
- [ ] Preventing multiple compression of an image
- [ ] Improve myself in dev.
